    <h3> Description:</h3>
    <p> 
        Japanese Curry, 
        aka Curry Rice (Kare Raisu, カレーライス), 
        is an exemplary comfort food and one of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice,
         as my mom would make it as frequently as I can recall.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that’s easy to make on busy nights, but it also tastes better on the second day.
